#+TITLE: Downloads
  If you want to, you can download some of my projects without compiling it
  yourself by using one of these options:
** ~crates.io~
   Some of my projects get published to [[https://crates.io][crates.io]] when their version bumps, and
   you can use them easily by installing [[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install][cargo]] and running ~cargo install
   <name>~ in your terminal.

*** Applications
    - [[https://crates.io/crates/eidolon][eidolon]]
    - [[https://crates.io/crates/raventhemer][raven]] Note: raven is published under the name raventhemer instead of
      raven, due to naming conflicts
